A simple weather forecast app that shows current weather and 5-day forecast for any city.

## How to set it up

First you need to get an API key from OpenWeatherMap:
1. Go to https://openweathermap.org/api 
2. Sign up for free account
3. Get your API key

Then update the code:
1. Open index.js file
2. Find this line: `const apiKey = "f695f305cfe5e8ae91cb87b5afb45649";`
3. Replace it with your API key

You also need these icon images in an "images" folder:
- search.png
- current location.png  
- clear.png

Just open index.html in your browser and it should work.
